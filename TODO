discord stuff needs updates to version 13.

so we need to handle a few events:
    guild member:
        joined server
        left server
        started typing somewhere on server
        stopped typing on server
        joined voice chat
        left voice chat
and a few status checks:
    guild member:
        is in voice chat at current time?

We also need the methods in discord to retrieve user's current online status
also a time.service.ts to create timeentries from both discord and clockify records.

Still need Schema for FCC account achievements
selector like #gatsby-focus-wrapper > div > div > div > div.container > div:nth-child(4) > div > table
Make scraper for FCC. Scrape user's credentials. Scrape specific credentials.

Note: for capstone submission, discord and fcc services are disabled. we replace real user data with dummy data instead in an effort to protect user privacy.
