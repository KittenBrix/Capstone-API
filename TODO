discord stuff needs updates to version 13.

so we need to handle a few events:
    guild member:
        joined server
        left server
        started typing somewhere on server
        stopped typing on server
        joined voice chat
        left voice chat
and a few status checks:
    guild member:
        is in voice chat at current time?

We also need the methods in discord to retrieve user's current online status
also a time.service.ts to create timeentries from both discord and clockify records.

Then we have authentication. I need to get Google OAuth2 working. A user must
log in to my app and *then* log in to google single sign on. This binds their
classroom email to the appUser, and also allows them to use those credentials
to access coursework lists for their cohort from our DB (we find all class ids
that they have access to. If they are a student appUser, they can see only assignment
due dates and their own submission states plus a link to the assignment) If they
are a teacher appUser, they get to see coursework for the class, plus students in it.
if they are an admin appUser, they get to see everything my personal account could get.
they only need to link once, from there, my application handles data displays.



We still need to make JWTS work. like, logging in using name/pass, and also refresh tokens.
refresh token needs finish. logging in works. refresh token finished. gotta test with insomnia.
need to set routes.



Still need Schema for FCC account achievements
selector like #gatsby-focus-wrapper > div > div > div > div.container > div:nth-child(4) > div > table
Make scraper for FCC. Scrape user's credentials. Scrape specific credentials.

Google Classroom seems like too much work. I can't do that despite wanting to.
I can do discord. I can do clockify. I can do FCC.
